 ### About Me
 I'm a sophomore computer science major at UCSD! I just moved back on campus for spring quarter so I'm currently living in the Sixth College apartments. I'm excited to learn more about software development at my upcoming internship this spring/summer as well which I'm starting this coming Monday. I'll be working mostly on automated testing for a healthcare related mobile app along with some backend API work in C#. I'm pretty nervous but I think it'll be a really good learning experience :3
 
 ### Hobbies
  - Baking! I really like to bake although it's a little more difficult to do so in the dorms. I like making cookie/brownie type things but also get cravings for more Asian-style desserts sometimes.
  - Art :) Just recently I downloaded the Procreate app which makes drawing and painting digitally a really smooth experience. The layer function is super cool and useful and I see myself doing a lot of art with the acrylic brushes available in the app. It's pretty amazing stuff. 
  First art piece with Procreate :)

  - Gaming :0 I'm mostly into JRPG's (I like story/character focused games a lot). I started FF7 recently which is a lot of campy fun and have tried a few demos of new RPG style games that are coming out soon or have come out, like Bravely Default II or Project Triangle Strategy. I also have like 100 hours on Hades oops.

### Netflix Recs
This is just a few shows I've been watching/have watched on Netflix that I've really liked and would recommend to almost anybody!
